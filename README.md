# wpdown
Wordpress post --> Markdown file

## Installation

This is a Chrome extension that never got fully polished + published to the Chrome store. If you want to try it out, clone this repository, then run the following commands from its directory:

```shell
npm install
npm run build
```

Then load the `build/` folder as an [unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#manifest) in Chrome. From the Wordpress editor page for a story, you should be able to click the squirrel in your Chrome navigation bar to download a Markdown file. (TODO: the squirrel doesn't work well as an icon; it should be changed to [the acorn](https://projects.seattletimes.com/2018/how-to-buy-a-home/assets/aside-graphics/acorn.png).
